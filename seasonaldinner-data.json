  "description": "*shijie (*时节), meaning “season” or “seasonal node” in Chinese, is a seasonal dinner series hosted at Initial Research’s SoHo space in New York, where artist dinners have long been a tradition of care and community. Marking the beginning of each new season, *Shijie* gathers people through shared palettes, intimate conversations, and the nourishment of nature’s offerings. Our first—and next—edition will take place in fall 2025. An announcement will follow soon."
